# text-her

### I was looking for a way to tell her "sorry, I cannot pick your call right now, I'm in this really long meeting with a colleague and I can't really do much with my phone right now", thought about an FCC article I read earlier this year and voila!. 
### Run this script in the background and she keeps getting lovely text messages, while I'm working.

#### Small Node.js project to text her intermittently.
